                    <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                    <p>Warthogs are wild members of the pig family, easily recognized by their large tusks and facial "warts." They are surprisingly fast and can run up to 30 miles per hour to escape predators.</p>
                    <p>Warthogs use their tusks for digging and defense. They often kneel on their front knees while grazing and are known for their comical, upright tails when they run.</p>
                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the warthogs at pen W14, near the savannah trail.</p>
