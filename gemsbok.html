                    <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                    <p>The gemsbok is a large antelope native to arid regions of Southern Africa. Instantly recognizable by its striking black-and-white facial markings and long, straight horns, the gemsbok is a symbol of grace and resilience in the desert.</p>
                    <p>Gemsbok are well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. They can go for long periods without water, obtaining moisture from the plants they eat. Both males and females have impressive horns, which they use for defense against predators.</p>
                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the gemsbok at pen B08, along the desert trail.</p>
