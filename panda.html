                    <h3>PANDA</h3>
                    <p>Giant pandas are beloved for their distinctive black-and-white fur and gentle nature. Native to China, pandas spend most of their day eating bamboo, which makes up 99% of their diet.</p>
                    <p>Pandas are excellent climbers and swimmers. Despite their size, they are shy and solitary animals, spending much of their time in dense bamboo forests.</p>
                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the pandas at pen P03, in the bamboo grove section.</p>
