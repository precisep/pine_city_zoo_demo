                    <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                    <p>Giraffes are the tallest living terrestrial animals and the largest ruminants. Native to Africa, they are known for their extremely long necks and legs, as well as their distinctive spotted patterns. Giraffes primarily eat leaves from acacia trees and are well adapted to reach high foliage that other herbivores cannot.</p>
                    <p>Giraffes live in savannahs and open woodlands. Their height allows them to spot predators from a distance, and their powerful legs can deliver strong kicks for defense.</p>
                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the giraffes at pen G12, near the observation deck.</p>
